## [419. Battleships in a Board](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/) (Medium)

Given an 2D board, count how many battleships are in it. The battleships are represented with `'X'``'.'`

- You receive a valid board, made of only battleships or empty slots.
- Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1xN` (1 row, N columns) or `Nx1` (N rows, 1 column), where N can be of any size.
- At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships - there are no adjacent battleships.

**Example:**
 

```
X..X
...X
...X
```

 In the above board there are 2 battleships.  

**Invalid Example:**

```
...X
XXXX
...X
```

 This is an invalid board that you will not receive - as battleships will always have a cell separating between them. 

**Follow up:**
Could you do it in **one-pass**, using only **O(1) extra memory** and **without modifying** the value of the board?

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [100%] 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countBattleships(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int row = 0; row < board.size(); row++)
        {
            for(int col = 0; col < board[row].size(); col++)
            {
                if(board[row][col] == 'X' && (row == 0 || board[row - 1][col] != 'X'))
                {
                    while(col < board[row].size() && board[row][col] == 'X')
                        col++;
                    result++;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
