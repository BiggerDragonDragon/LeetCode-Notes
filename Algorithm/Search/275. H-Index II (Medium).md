## [275. H-Index II](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/) (Medium)

Given an array of citations **sorted in ascending order** (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

  

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index *h* if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N âˆ’ h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each."

  

**Example:**

  

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

  

**Note:**

  

If there are several possible values for *h*, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

  

**Follow up:**

  

- This is a follow up problem to [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/), where `citations` is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
- Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [100%] 

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        int N = citations.size();
        int left = 0;
        int right = citations.size() - 1;
        while(left <= right)
        {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if(citations[mid] < N - mid)
                left = mid + 1;
            else if(mid > left && citations[mid - 1] >= N - mid + 1)
                right = mid - 1;
            else
                return N - mid;
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```
