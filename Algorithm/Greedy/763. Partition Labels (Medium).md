## [763. Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels/) (Medium)

A string `S` of lowercase letters is given.  We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts. 

  

**Example 1:**
 

```
Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.
```

 



  

**Note:**

1. `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
2. `S` will consist of lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> partitionLabels(string S) {
        vector<int> finalLoc(26, -1);
        for(int i = S.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            if(finalLoc[S[i] - 'a'] == -1)
                finalLoc[S[i] - 'a'] = i;
        vector<int> result;
        int index = 0;
        while(index < S.size())
        {
            int length = 0;
            int start = index;
            int end = finalLoc[S[index] - 'a'];
            while(index != end)
            {
                index++;
                if(finalLoc[S[index] - 'a'] > end)
                    end = finalLoc[S[index] - 'a'];
            }
            index++;
            result.push_back(end - start + 1);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
