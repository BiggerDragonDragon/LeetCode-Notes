## [406. Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://leetcode.com/problems/queue-reconstruction-by-height/) (Medium)

Suppose you have a random list of people standing in a queue. Each person is described by a pair of integers `(h, k)`, where `h` is the height of the person and `k` is the number of people in front of this person who have a height greater than or equal to `h`. Write an algorithm to reconstruct the queue.

  **Note:**
 The number of people is less than 1,100.   

**Example** 

```
Input:
[[7,0], [4,4], [7,1], [5,0], [6,1], [5,2]]

Output:
[[5,0], [7,0], [5,2], [6,1], [4,4], [7,1]]
```

## Solution (C++)

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [33.27%] 

```c++
bool cmp(vector<int> people1, vector<int>people2)
{
    if(people1[0] == people2[0])
        return people1[1] > people2[1];
    else
        return people1[0] < people2[0];
}

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> reconstructQueue(vector<vector<int>>& people) {
        sort(people.begin(), people.end(), cmp);
        vector<vector<int>> result(people.size(), vector<int>(2, 0));
        vector<int> blankLoc(people.size(), 0);
        for(int i = 0; i < people.size(); i++)
            blankLoc[i] = i;
        for(int i = 0; i < people.size(); i++)
        {
            result[blankLoc[people[i][1]]] = people[i];
            blankLoc.erase(blankLoc.begin() + people[i][1]);
        }  
        return result;
    }
};
```
