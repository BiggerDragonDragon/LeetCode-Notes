## [376. Wiggle Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/wiggle-subsequence/) (Medium)

A sequence of numbers is called a **wiggle sequence** if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, `[1,7,4,9,2,5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6,-3,5,-7,3)` are alternately positive and negative. In contrast, `[1,4,7,2,5]` and `[1,7,4,5,5]` are not wiggle sequences, the first because its first two differences are positive and the second because its last difference is zero.

Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [100%] (Greedy)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int wiggleMaxLength(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() <= 1)
            return nums.size();
        int maxLength = 1;
        int preprenum = nums[0];
        int prenum = nums[1];
        for(int i = 2; i < nums.size(); i++)
        {
            int nownum = nums[i];
            int diff = nownum - prenum;
            int prediff = prenum - preprenum;
            if(diff != 0 && prediff !=0 && maxLength == 1)
                maxLength++;
            if(diff * prediff < 0)
            {
                maxLength++;
                prenum = nums[i];
                preprenum = nums[i - 1];
            }
            else
            {
                prenum = nums[i];
            }
        }
        return maxLength; 
    }
};
```
