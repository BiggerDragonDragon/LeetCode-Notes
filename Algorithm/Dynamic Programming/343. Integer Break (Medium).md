## [343. Integer Break](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/) (Medium)

Given a positive integer *n*, break it into the sum of **at least** two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can get.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
```

**Note**: You may assume that *n* is not less than 2 and not larger than 58.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int integerBreak(int n) {
        if(n < 2)
            return 0;
        int size = n + 1 > 10? n + 1 : 10;
        vector<int> dp(size, 0);
        dp[2] = 1;
        dp[3] = 2;
        dp[4] = 4;
        dp[5] = 6;
        for(int i = 6; i <= n; i++)
        {
            if((i - 1) % 3 == 0)
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] / 3 * 4;
            else
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] / 2 * 3;
        }
        return dp[n];
    }
};

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int integerBreak(int n) {
        if(n < 4)
            return n - 1;
        int result = 1;
        while(n > 4)
        {
            result *= 3;
            n -= 3;
        }
        return result * n;
    }
};

#### Explanation:

```
The first thing we should consider is : What is the max product if we break a number N into two factors?

I use a function to express this product: f=x(N-x)

When x=N/2, we get the maximum of this function.

However, factors should be integers. Thus the maximum is (N/2)*(N/2) when N is even or (N-1)/2 *(N+1)/2 when N is odd.

When the maximum of f is larger than N, we should do the break.

(N/2)*(N/2)>=N, then N>=4

(N-1)/2 *(N+1)/2>=N, then N>=5

These two expressions mean that factors should be less than 4, otherwise we can do the break and get a better product. The factors in last result should be 1, 2 or 3. Obviously, 1 should be abandoned. Thus, the factors of the perfect product should be 2 or 3.

The reason why we should use 3 as many as possible is

For 6, 3 * 3>2 * 2 * 2. Thus, the optimal product should contain no more than three 2.
