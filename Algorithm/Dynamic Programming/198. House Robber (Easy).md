## [198. House Robber](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/) (Easy)

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [100%] (dp)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size() == 0)
            return 0;
        if(nums.size() == 1)
            return nums[0];
        vector<int> dp(nums.size(), 0);
        int last1 = nums[0];
        int last2 = max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        for(int i = 2; i < nums.size(); i++)
        {
            int nowLast = max(last2, last1 + nums[i]);
            last1 = last2;
            last2 = nowLast;
        }
        return last2;
    }
};
```
