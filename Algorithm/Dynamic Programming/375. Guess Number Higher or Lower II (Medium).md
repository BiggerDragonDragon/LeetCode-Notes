## [375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower-ii/) (Medium)

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

  

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

  

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

  

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay **$x**. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

  

**Example:**

  

```
n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
```

  

Given a particular **n â‰¥ 1**, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a **win**.

## Solution (C++)

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [86.32%] (dp)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++)
            dp[i][i + 1] = i;
        for(int diff = 2; diff < n; diff++)
        {
            for(int i = 1; i + diff <= n; i++)
            {
                int start = i;
                int end = i + diff;
                int result = INT_MAX;
                for(int mid = start + 1; mid < end; mid++)
                    result = min(result, (mid + max(dp[start][mid - 1], dp[mid + 1][end])));
                dp[start][end] = result;
            }
        }
        return dp[1][n];
    }
};
```
