## [174. Dungeon Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/) (Hard)

The demons had captured the princess (**P**) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (**K**) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.

The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.

Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (*negative* integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (*0's*) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (*positive* integers).

In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.

 

**Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.**

For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least **7** if he follows the optimal path `RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN`.

| -2 (K) | -3   | 3      |
| ------ | ---- | ------ |
| -5     | -10  | 1      |
| 10     | 30   | -5 (P) |

 

**Note:**

- The knight's health has no upper bound.
- Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [100%] (dp)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int calculateMinimumHP(vector<vector<int>>& dungeon) {
        if(dungeon.size() == 0)
            return 0;
        int rows = dungeon.size();
        int cols = dungeon[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(rows, vector<int>(cols, 0));
        if(dungeon[rows - 1][cols - 1] < 0)
            dp[rows - 1][cols - 1] = -dungeon[rows - 1][cols - 1];
        else
            dp[rows - 1][cols - 1] = 0;
        for(int row = rows - 2; row >= 0; row--)
        {
            dp[row][cols - 1] = max(dp[row + 1][cols - 1] - dungeon[row][cols - 1], 0);
        }
        for(int col = cols - 2; col >= 0; col--)
        {
            dp[rows - 1][col] = max(dp[rows - 1][col + 1] - dungeon[rows - 1][col], 0);
        }
        for(int row = rows - 2; row >= 0; row--)
            for(int col = cols - 2; col >= 0; col--)
                dp[row][col] = max(min(dp[row + 1][col], dp[row][col + 1]) - dungeon[row][col], 0);
        return dp[0][0] + 1;
    }
};
```
