## [551. Student Attendance Record I](https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-i/) (Easy)

You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:  

 

1. **'A'** : Absent. 
2. **'L'** : Late.
3.  **'P'** : Present. 

 A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain **more than one 'A' (absent)** or **more than two continuous 'L' (late)**.    

  

You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

  

**Example 1:**
 

```
Input: "PPALLP"
Output: True
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: "PPALLL"
Output: False
```

        {
            if(s[i] == 'A')
                AbsentCount++;
            else if(s[i] == 'L')
                if(i > 0 && s[i - 1] == 'L' && i + 1 < s.size() && s[i + 1] == 'L')
                    return false;
        }
        return AbsentCount < 2;
    }
