## [236 Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/) (Medium)

Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

 

**Note:**

- All of the nodes' values will be unique.
- p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

```c++
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        vector<TreeNode*> Path;
        vector<vector<TreeNode*>> result;
        bool isFinished = false;
        findPath(root, p, Path, result, isFinished);
        Path.clear();
        isFinished = false;
        findPath(root, q, Path, result, isFinished);    
        TreeNode* finalResult = NULL;
        for(int i = 0; i < result[0].size() && i < result[1].size(); i++)
            if(result[0][i] == result[1][i])
                finalResult = result[0][i];
        return finalResult;
    }
    void findPath(TreeNode* root, TreeNode *p, vector<TreeNode*>& path, vector<vector<TreeNode*>>& result, bool& isFinished)
    {
        if(root == NULL || isFinished == true)
            return;
        path.push_back(root);
        if(p == root)
        {
            isFinished = true;
            result.push_back(path);
            return;
        }
        findPath(root->left, p, path, result, isFinished);
        findPath(root->right, p, path, result, isFinished);
        path.pop_back();
    }
};
