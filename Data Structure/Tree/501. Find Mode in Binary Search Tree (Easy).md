## [501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/) (Easy)

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the [mode(s)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(statistics)) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

  

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

  

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than or equal to** the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than or equal to** the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

  

 

  

For example:
 Given BST `[1,null,2,2]`,

  

```
   1
    \
     2
    /
   2
```

  

 

  

return `[2]`.

  

**Note:** If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

  

**Follow up:** Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).

 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}

public:
    vector<int> findMode(TreeNode* root) {
        int MaxCount = 0;
        vector<int> result;
        if(!root)
            return result;
        int nowNum = root->val;
        int nowCount = 0;
        getResult(root, nowNum, nowCount, MaxCount, result );

    void getResult(TreeNode *node, int& nowNum, int &nowCount, int &MaxCount, vector<int>& result)
    {
        if(!node)
            return;
        getResult(node->left, nowNum, nowCount, MaxCount, result);
        if(node->val == nowNum)
        {
            nowCount++;
        }
        else
            nowCount = 1;
        nowNum = node->val;
        if(MaxCount == nowCount)
            result.push_back(node->val);
        if(MaxCount < nowCount)
        {
            result.clear();
            result.push_back(node->val);
            MaxCount = nowCount;
        }
        getResult(node->right, nowNum, nowCount, MaxCount, result);
    }
