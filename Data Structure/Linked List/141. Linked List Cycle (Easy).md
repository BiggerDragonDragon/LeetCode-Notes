## [141. Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/) (Easy)

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [100%]

```c++
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode * moveOne = head;
        ListNode * moveTwo = head;
        while(moveTwo)
        {
            moveTwo = moveTwo->next;
            if(moveTwo)
            {
                moveTwo = moveTwo->next;
                moveOne = moveOne->next;
                if(moveTwo == moveOne)
                    return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
