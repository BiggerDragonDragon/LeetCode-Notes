## [430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-a-multilevel-doubly-linked-list/) (Medium)

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

 

**Example:**

```
Input:
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL

Output:
1-2-3-7-8-11-12-9-10-4-5-6-NULL
```

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [70.14%] 

```c++
/*
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
public:
    int val;
    Node* prev;
    Node* next;
    Node* child;

    Node() {}

    Node(int _val, Node* _prev, Node* _next, Node* _child) {
        val = _val;
        prev = _prev;
        next = _next;
        child = _child;
    }
};
*/
class Solution {
public:
    Node* flatten(Node* head) {
        if(!head)
            return NULL;
        stack<Node*> myStack;
        myStack.push(head);
        Node* newHead = new Node();
        Node* moveNode = newHead;
        while(!myStack.empty())
        {
            Node* nowHead = myStack.top();
            myStack.pop();
            if(!nowHead)
                continue;
            myStack.push(nowHead->next);
            myStack.push(nowHead->child);
            nowHead->prev = moveNode;
            nowHead->next = NULL;
            nowHead->child = NULL;
            moveNode->next = nowHead;
            moveNode = nowHead;
        }
        newHead->next->prev = NULL;
        return newHead->next;
    }
};
```
