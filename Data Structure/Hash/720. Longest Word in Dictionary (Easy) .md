## [720. Longest Word in Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary/solution/) (Easy)

Given a list of strings `words` representing an English Dictionary, find the longest word in `words` that can be built one character at a time by other words in `words`.  If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.

  If there is no answer, return the empty string.  

**Example 1:**
 

```
Input: 
words = ["w","wo","wor","worl", "world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: 
The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
```

 



  

**Example 2:**
 

```
Input: 
words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: 
Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller than "apply".
```

 



  

**Note:** 

All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.

 

The length of `words` will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.

 

The length of `words[i]` will be in the range `[1, 30]`.

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [40.05%] (Set)

```c++
bool cmp(string& word1, string& word2)
{
    if(word1.size() < word2.size())
        return true;
    else if(word1.size() == word2.size())
        return word1 > word2;
    else
        return false;
}

class Solution {
public:
    string longestWord(vector<string>& words) {
        sort(words.begin(), words.end(), cmp);
        string maxLengthstr = "";
        set<string> strSet;
        strSet.insert("");
        for(int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++)
        {
            if(strSet.count(words[i].substr(0, words[i].size() - 1)) == 1)
            {
                maxLengthstr = words[i];
                strSet.insert(words[i]);
            }
        }
        return maxLengthstr;
    }
};
```
