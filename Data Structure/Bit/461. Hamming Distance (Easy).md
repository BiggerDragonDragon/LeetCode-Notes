## [461. Hamming Distance](https://leetcode.com/problems/hamming-distance/) (Easy)

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**
 0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 231. 

**Example:** 

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)
       ↑   ↑

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

#### Approach #1  [Accepted] [100%] (DFS)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int distance = 0;
        while(x || y)
        {
            if(x % 2 != y % 2)
                distance += 1;
            x /= 2;
            y /= 2;
        }
        return distance;
    }
};
```

#### Approach #2  [Accepted] [100%] (Bits)

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int xr = x^y;
        cout<<xr;
        int cnt=0;
        while(xr){
            xr&=(xr-1);
            cnt++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
